## Installation

```javascript
npm i micro-graphql-svelte --save
```

**Note** - this project ships standard, modern JavaScript (ES6, object spread, etc) that works in all evergreen browsers. If you need to support ES5 environments like IE11, just add an alias pointing to the ES5 build in your webpack config like so

```javascript
alias: {
  "micro-graphql-svelte": "node_modules/micro-graphql-svelte/index-es5.js"
},
```

(`alias` goes under the `resolve` section in webpack.config.js)

## Creating a client

Before you do anything, you'll need to create a client.

```javascript
import { Client, setDefaultClient } from "micro-graphql-svelte";

const client = new Client({
  endpoint: "/graphql",
  fetchOptions: { credentials: "include" }
});

setDefaultClient(client);
```

Now that client will be used by default, everywhere, unless you manually pass in a different client to a query's options, as discussed below.

### Accessing the client

To access the default client anywhere in your codebase, use the `getDefaultClient` method.

```javascript
import { getDefaultClient } from "micro-graphql-svelte";

const client = getDefaultClient();
```

### Client options

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Option  | Description |
| -------| ----------- |
| `endpoint` | URL for your GraphQL endpoint |
| `fetchOptions`  | Options to send along with all fetches|
| `cacheSize`  | Default cache size to use for all caches created by this client, as needed, for all queries it processes|

### Client api

<table class="client-api">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</ht>
      <th>Description</ht>
    </tr>
  </thead>

      <td>Manually run this GraphQL mutation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>forceUpdate(query)</code></td>
      <td>Manually update any components rendering that query. This is useful if you (dangerously) update a query's cache, as discussed in the caching section, below</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>subscribeMutation({ when, run })</code></td>
      <td>Manually subscribe to a mutation, in order to manually update the cache. See below for more info</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Running queries and mutations

### Preloading queries

It's always a good idea to preload a query as soon as you know it'll be requested downstream by a (possibly lazy loaded) component. To preload a query, call the `preload` method on the client, and pass a query, and any args you might have.

```javascript
import { getDefaultClient } from "micro-graphql-svelte";

const client = getDefaultClient();
client.preload(YourQuery, variables);
```

### Queries

```js
import { query } from "micro-graphql-svelte";

let { queryState, resultsState, sync } = query(YOUR_QUERY);
$: booksSync($searchState);
```

`query` takes the following arguments

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Arg | Description | 
| -------| ----------- |
| `query: string` | The query text |
| `options: object`  | The query's options (optional) |

The options argument, if supplied, can contain these properties

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Option  | Description |
| -------| ----------- |
| `onMutation` | A map of mutations, along with handlers. This is how you update your cached results after mutations, and is explained more fully below |
| `client`  | Manually pass in a client to be used for this query, which will override the default client|
| `cache`  | Manually pass in a cache object to be used for this query, which will override the default cache|
| `initialSearch`  | If you'd like to run a query immediately, without calling the returned sync method, provide the arguments object here.|
| `activate`  | Optional function that will run whenever the query becomes active, in other words the query store is subscribed by at least one component, or manual call to `.subscribe`.|
| `deactivate`  | Optional function that will run whenever the query becomes in-active, in other words the query store is not subscribed by any components, or manual calls to `.subscribe`.|
| `postProcess` | An optional function to run on new search results. You can perform side effects in here, ie preloading images, and optionally return new results, which will then become the results for this query. If you return nothing, the original results will be used. |

Be sure to use the `compress` tag to remove un-needed whitespace from your query text, since it will be sent via HTTP GETâ€”for more information, see [here](./compress). An even better option would be to use my [persisted queries helper](https://github.com/arackaf/generic-persistgraphql). This not only removes the entire query text from your network requests altogether, but also from your bundled code.

`query` returns an object with a `queryState` property, which will be a store with your query's current results, as well as a `sync` function, which you can call anytime to update the query's current variables. Your query will not actually run until you've called sync. If your query does not need any variables, just call it immediately with an empty object.

### Query results

The `queryState` store has the following properties

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Props | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|`loading`|Fetch is executing for your query|
|`loaded`|Fetch has finished executing for your query|
|`data`|If the last fetch finished successfully, this will contain the data returned, else null|
|`currentQuery`|The query that was run, which produced the current results. This updates synchronously with updates to `data`, so you can use changes here as an easy way to subscribe to query result changes. This will not have a value until there are results passed to `data`. In other words, changes to `loading` do not affect this value|
|`error`|If the last fetch did not finish successfully, this will contain the errors that were returned, else `null`|
|`reload`|`function`: Manually re-fetches the current query|
|`clearCache`|`function`: Clear the cache for this query|
| `softReset` |`function`: Clears the cache, but does **not** re-issue any queries. It can optionally take an argument of new, updated results, which will replace the current `data` props |
| `hardReset` |`function`: Clears the cache, and re-load the current query from the network|

The `resultsState` store contains the current query's results. This store stays in sync with `$queryState.data`.

If you want to run code when the current query's results, and **only** the current query's results changes, use this store.

### Mutations

```js
import { mutation } from "micro-graphql-svelte";

const { mutationState } = mutation(YOUR_MUTATION);
```

The mutation function takes the following arguments.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Arg         | Description  |
| ------------- | --------- |
| `mutation: string`     | Mutation text |
| `options: object`    | Mutation options (optional) |

The options argument, if supplied, can contain this property

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Option        | Description  |
| ------------- | --------- |
| `client`     | Override the client used |

### Mutation results

`mutation` returns a store with the following properties.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Option        | Description  |
| ------------- | --------- |
| `running`     | Mutation is executing |
| `finished`    | Mutation has finished executing|
| `runMutation` | A function you can call when you want to run your mutation. Pass it your variables |

## Caching

The client object maintains a cache of each query it comes across when processing your components. The cache is LRU with a default size of 10 and, again, stored at the level of each specific query, not the GraphQL type. As your instances mount and unmount, and update, the cache will be checked for existing results to matching queries.

### Cache object

You can import the `Cache` class like this

```javascript
import { Cache } from "micro-graphql-svelte";
```

When instantiating a new cache object, you can optionally pass in a cache size.

```javascript
let cache = new Cache(15);
```

#### Cache api

The cache object has the following properties and methods

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Member | Description  |
| ----- | --------- |
| `get entries()`   | An array of the current entries. Each entry is an array of length 2, of the form `[key, value]`. The cache entry key is the actual GraphQL url query that was run. If you'd like to inspect it, see the variables that were sent, etc, just use your favorite url parsing utility, like `url-parse`. And of course the cache value itself is whatever the server sent back for that query. If the query is still pending, then the entry will be a promise for that request. |
| `get(key)` | Gets the cache entry for a particular key      |
| `set(key, value)` | Sets the cache entry for a particular key  |
| `delete(key)`     | Deletes the cache entry for a particular key |
| `clearCache()`    | Clears all entries from the cache |

### Cache invalidation

The onMutation option that query options take is an object, or array of objects of the form `{ when: string|regularExpression, run: function }`

`when` is a string or regular expression that's tested against each result of any mutations that finish. If the mutation has any result set names that match, `run` will be called with three arguments: an object with these properties, described below, `{ softReset, currentResults, hardReset, cache, refresh }`; the entire mutation result; and the mutation's `variables` object.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Arg  | Description  |
| ---| -------- |
| `softReset` | Clears the cache, but does **not** re-issue any queries. It can optionally take an argument of new, updated results, which will replace the current `data` props |
| `currentResults` | The current results that are passed as your `data` prop |
| `hardReset` | Clears the cache, and re-load the current query from the network|
| `cache`  | The actual cache object. You can enumerate its entries, and update whatever you need|
| `refresh`   | Refreshes the current query, from cache if present. You'll likely want to call this after modifying the cache  |

Many use cases follow. They're based on a hypothetical book tracking website.

The code below uses a publicly available GraphQL endpoint created by my [mongo-graphql-starter project](https://github.com/arackaf/mongo-graphql-starter). You can run these examples from the demo folder of this repository. Just run `npm i` then run the `npm run demo` and `npm starte` scripts in separate terminals, and open `http://localhost:8082/`

#### Hard Reset: Reload the query after any relevant mutation

Let's say whenever a mutation happens, we want to immediately invalidate any related queries' caches, and reload the current data from the network. We understand this may cause a book we just edited to immediately disappear from our current search results, since it no longer matches our search criteria.

The `hardReset` method that's passed makes this easy. Let's see how to use this in a (contrived) component that queries, and displays some books and subjects.

```svelte
<script>
  import { query } from "micro-graphql-svelte";
  import { getContext } from "svelte";
  import ShowData from "./ShowData.svelte";
  import { BOOKS_QUERY, ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY } from "../../savedQueries";

  let searchState = getContext("search_params");

  let { queryState: booksState, sync: booksSync } = query(BOOKS_QUERY, {
    onMutation: { when: /(update|create|delete)Books?/, run: ({ hardReset }) => hardReset() }
  });
  let { queryState: subjectsState, sync: subjectsSync } = query(ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY, {
    onMutation: { when: /(update|create|delete)Subjects?/, run: ({ hardReset }) => hardReset() }
  });

  $: booksSync($searchState);
  $: subjectsSync({});
</script>

<ShowData booksData={$booksState} subejctsData={$subjectsState} />
```

Here we specify a regex matching every kind of book, or subject mutation, and upon completion, we just clear the cache, and reload by calling `hardReset()`. It's hard not to be a littler dissatisfied with this solution; the boilerplate is non-trivial.

Assuming our GraphQL operations have a consistent naming structureâ€”and they should, and in this case doâ€”then some pretty obvious patterns emerge. We can write some basic helpers to remove some of this boilerplate.

```javascript
//hardResetHelpers.js
import { query } from "micro-graphql-svelte";

export const hardResetQuery = (type, queryToRun, options = {}) =>
  query(queryToRun, {
    ...options,
    onMutation: {
      when: new RegExp(`(update|create|delete)${type}s?`),
      run: ({ hardReset }) => hardReset()
    }
  });
```

which we _could_ use like this

```svelte
<script>
  import { getContext } from "svelte";
  import ShowData from "./ShowData.svelte";
  import { BOOKS_QUERY, ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY } from "../../savedQueries";
  import { hardResetQuery } from "./hardResetHelpers"

  let searchState = getContext("search_params");

  let { queryState: booksState, sync: booksSync } = hardResetQuery("Book", BOOKS_QUERY);
  let { queryState: subjectsState, sync: subjectsSync } = hardResetQuery("Subject", ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY);

  $: booksSync($searchState);
  $: subjectsSync({});
</script>

<ShowData booksData={$booksState} subejctsData={$subjectsState} />
```

but really, why not go the extra mile and make wrappers for our various types, like so

```javascript
//hardResetHelpers.js
import { query } from "micro-graphql-svelte";

export const hardResetQuery = (type, queryToRun, options = {}) =>
  query(queryToRun, {
    ...options,
    onMutation: {
      when: new RegExp(`(update|create|delete)${type}s?`),
      run: ({ hardReset }) => hardReset()
    }
  });

export const bookHardResetQuery = (...args) => hardResetQuery("Book", ...args);
export const subjectHardResetQuery = (...args) => hardResetQuery("Subject", ...args);
```

which simplifies the code to just this

```svelte
<script>
  import { getContext } from "svelte";
  import ShowData from "./ShowData.svelte";
  import { BOOKS_QUERY, ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY } from "../../savedQueries";
  import { bookHardResetQuery, subjectHardResetQuery } from "./hardResetHelpers";

  let searchState = getContext("search_params");

  let { queryState: booksState, sync: booksSync } = bookHardResetQuery(BOOKS_QUERY);
  let { queryState: subjectsState, sync: subjectsSync } = subjectHardResetQuery(ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY);

  $: booksSync($searchState);
  $: subjectsSync({});
</script>

<ShowData booksData={$booksState} subejctsData={$subjectsState} />
```

#### Soft Reset: Update current results, but clear the cache

Assume that after a mutation you want to update your current results based on what was changed, clear all cache entries, including the existing one, but **not** run any network requests. So if you're currently searching for an author of Dumas Malone, but one of the current results was written by Shelby Foote, and you click the book's edit button and fix it, you want that book to now show the updated value, but stay in the current results, since re-loading the current query and having the book just vanish is bad UX in your opinion.

Here's the same component from above, but with our new cache strategy

```svelte
<script>
  import { query } from "micro-graphql-svelte";
  import { getContext } from "svelte";
  import ShowData from "./ShowData.svelte";
  import { BOOKS_QUERY, ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY } from "../../savedQueries";

  let searchState = getContext("search_params");

  let { queryState: booksState, sync: booksSync } = query(BOOKS_QUERY, {
    onMutation: {
      when: /(update|create|delete)Books?/,
      run: ({ softReset, currentResults }, resp) => {
        const updatedBooks = resp.updateBooks?.Books ?? [resp.updateBook.Book];
        updatedBooks.forEach(book => {
          let CachedBook = currentResults.allBooks.Books.find(b => b._id == book._id);
          CachedBook && Object.assign(CachedBook, book);
        });
        softReset(currentResults);
      }
    }
  });
  let { queryState: subjectsState, sync: subjectsSync } = query(ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY, {
    onMutation: {
      when: /(update|create|delete)Subjects?/,
      run: ({ softReset, currentResults }, resp) => {
        const updatedSubjects = resp.updateSubjects?.Subjects ?? [resp.updateSubject.Subject];
        updatedSubjects.forEach(subject => {
          let CachedSubject = currentResults.allSubjects.Subjects.find(b => b._id == subject._id);
          CachedSubject && Object.assign(CachedSubject, subject);
        });
        softReset(currentResults);
      }
    }
  });

  $: booksSync($searchState);
  $: subjectsSync({});
</script>

<ShowData booksData={$booksState} subejctsData={$subjectsState} />

```

Whenever a mutation comes back with `updateBook` or `updateBooks` results, we manually update our current results, then call `softReset`, which clears our cache, including the current cache result; so if you page up, then come back down to where you were, a **new** network request will be run, and your edited books may no longer be there, if they no longer match the search results. And likewise for subjects.

Obviously this is more boilerplate than we'd ever want to write in practice, so let's tuck it behind a helper, like we did before.

```javascript
//softResetHelpers.js
import { query } from "micro-graphql-svelte";

export const softResetQuery = (type, queryToUse, options = {}) =>
  query(queryToUse, {
    ...options,
    onMutation: {
      when: new RegExp(`update${type}s?`),
      run: ({ softReset, currentResults }, resp) => {
        const updatedItems = resp[`update${type}s`]?.[`${type}s`] ?? [resp[`update${type}`][type]];
        updatedItems.forEach(updatedItem => {
          let CachedItem = currentResults[`all${type}s`][`${type}s`].find(item => item._id == updatedItem._id);
          CachedItem && Object.assign(CachedItem, updatedItem);
        });
        softReset(currentResults);
      }
    }
  });

export const bookSoftResetQuery = (...args) => softResetQuery("Book", ...args);
export const subjectSoftResetQuery = (...args) => softResetQuery("Subject", ...args);
```

which we can use like this

```svelte
<script>
  import { getContext } from "svelte";
  import ShowData from "./ShowData.svelte";
  import { BOOKS_QUERY, ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY } from "../../savedQueries";
  import { bookSoftResetQuery, subjectSoftResetQuery } from "./softResetHelpers";

  let searchState = getContext("search_params");

  let { queryState: booksState, sync: booksSync } = bookSoftResetQuery(BOOKS_QUERY);
  let { queryState: subjectsState, sync: subjectsSync } = subjectSoftResetQuery(ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY);

  $: booksSync($searchState);
  $: subjectsSync({});
</script>

<ShowData booksData={$booksState} subejctsData={$subjectsState} />
```

#### Manually update all affected cache entries

Let's say you want to intercept mutation results, and manually update your cache. This is difficult to get right, so be careful. You'll likely only want to do this with data that are not searched or filtered, but even then, softReset will likely be good enough.

For this, we can call the `subscribeMutation` method on the client object, and pass in the same `when` test, and `run` callback as before. Except now the `run` callback will receive a `refreshActiveQueries` callback, which we can use to force any queries showing data from a particular query to update itself from the now-updated cache. This function returns a cleanup function which you can call to remove the subscription.

The manual solution might look something like this

```javascript
//cacheHelpers.js
export const syncCollection = (current, newResultsLookup) => {
  return current.map(item => {
    const updatedItem = newResultsLookup.get(item._id);
    return updatedItem ? Object.assign({}, item, updatedItem) : item;
  });
};
```

and

```svelte
<script>
  import { getDefaultClient, query } from "micro-graphql-svelte";
  import { getContext } from "svelte";
  import ShowData from "./ShowData.svelte";
  import { BOOKS_QUERY, ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY } from "../../savedQueries";
  import { syncCollection } from "./cacheHelpers";

  const graphQLClient = getDefaultClient();

  graphQLClient.subscribeMutation([
    {
      when: /updateBooks?/,
      run: ({ refreshActiveQueries }, resp, variables) => {
        const cache = graphQLClient.getCache(BOOKS_QUERY);
        const newResults = resp.updateBook ? [resp.updateBook.Book] : resp.updateBooks.Books;
        const newResultsLookup = new Map(newResults.map(item => [item._id, item]));

        for (let [uri, { data }] of cache.entries) {
          data["allBooks"]["Books"] = syncCollection(data["allBooks"]["Books"], newResultsLookup);
        }

        refreshActiveQueries(BOOKS_QUERY);
      }
    }
  ]);

  graphQLClient.subscribeMutation([
    {
      when: /updateSubjects?/,
      run: ({ refreshActiveQueries }, resp, variables) => {
        const cache = graphQLClient.getCache(ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY);
        const newResults = resp.updateSubject
          ? [resp.updateSubject.Subject]
          : resp.updateSubjects.Subjects;
        const newResultsLookup = new Map(newResults.map(item => [item._id, item]));

        for (let [uri, { data }] of cache.entries) {
          data["allSubjects"]["Subjects"] = syncCollection(
            data["allSubjects"]["Subjects"],
            newResultsLookup
          );
        }

        refreshActiveQueries(ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY);
      }
    }
  ]);

  let searchState = getContext("search_params");

  let { queryState: booksState, sync: booksSync } = query(BOOKS_QUERY);
  let { queryState: subjectsState, sync: subjectsSync } = query(ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY);

  $: booksSync($searchState);
  $: subjectsSync({});
</script>

<ShowData booksData={$booksState} subejctsData={$subjectsState} />
```

It's a lot of code, but as always the idea is that you'd wrap it all into some re-usable helpers, like this

```javascript
//cacheHelpers.js
import { getDefaultClient } from "micro-graphql-svelte";

export const syncCollection = (current, newResultsLookup) => {
  return current.map(item => {
    const updatedItem = newResultsLookup.get(item._id);
    return updatedItem ? Object.assign({}, item, updatedItem) : item;
  });
};

export const syncQueryToCache = (query, type) => {
  const graphQLClient = getDefaultClient();
  graphQLClient.subscribeMutation([
    {
      when: new RegExp(`update${type}s?`),
      run: ({ refreshActiveQueries }, resp, variables) => {
        const cache = graphQLClient.getCache(query);
        const newResults = resp[`update${type}`] ? [resp[`update${type}`][type]] : resp[`update${type}s`][`${type}s`];
        const newResultsLookup = new Map(newResults.map(item => [item._id, item]));

        for (let [uri, { data }] of cache.entries) {
          data[`all${type}s`][`${type}s`] = syncCollection(data[`all${type}s`][`${type}s`], newResultsLookup);
        }

        refreshActiveQueries(query);
      }
    }
  ]);
};
```

which cuts the usage code to just this

```svelte
<script>
  import { query } from "micro-graphql-svelte";
  import { getContext } from "svelte";
  import ShowData from "./ShowData.svelte";
  import { BOOKS_QUERY, ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY } from "../../savedQueries";
  import { syncQueryToCache } from "./cacheHelpers";

  syncQueryToCache(BOOKS_QUERY, "Book");
  syncQueryToCache(ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY, "Subject");

  let searchState = getContext("search_params");

  let { queryState: booksState, sync: booksSync } = query(BOOKS_QUERY);
  let { queryState: subjectsState, sync: subjectsSync } = query(ALL_SUBJECTS_QUERY);

  $: booksSync($searchState);
  $: subjectsSync({});
</script>

<ShowData booksData={$booksState} subejctsData={$subjectsState} />
```

The above code assumes this component will only ever render once. If that's not the case, put these calls to `subscribeMutation` somewhere else, that will only ever run one. A svelte `<script context="module">` section may be a good candidate. See [the docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#script_context_module) for more info. If you decide to go this route, be careful. Those script sections will run as soon as they're parsed, which means a component's module script further down the component tree will run _before_ components further up. So if you try to set your default client in a module script in your root App component, and then set up subscriptions in module scripts in components further down the tree, you'll get a null reference exception, since the default client will not have been set. You'll instead want to set up your default client, and also any subscriptions in your root component (and also the root component for any code-split points). Or you could keep your client object as a local module's export, and just use that everywhere, and pass it to `setDefaultClient` in your app's entry point.

#### A note on cache management code

There's always a risk with "micro" libraries resulting in more application code overall, since they do too little. Remember, this library passes on doing client-side cache updating not so that it can artificially shrink it's bundle size, but rather because this is a problem that's all but impossible to do in an automated way that covers all use cases (see the repo's main README for an explanation).

Assuming your GraphQL endpoint has a consistent naming scheme, it should be straightforward to hand-craft a caching strategy that's tailored to your app's needs.

## Manually running queries or mutations

It's possible some pieces of data may need to be loaded from, and stored in your state manager, rather than fetched via a component's lifecycle. The `query` and `mutation` stores run queries and mutations through the client object you're already setting via `setDefaultClient`. You can use its api to interact with your GraphQL endpoint manually if you need. See the `runQuery` and `runMutation` methods documented above.

## Use in old browsers

By default this library ships modern, standard JavaScript, which should work in all decent browsers. If you have to support older browsers like IE, then just add the following alias to your webpack's resolve section

```javascript
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "micro-graphql-svelte": "node_modules/micro-graphql-svelte/index-es5.js"
    },
    modules: [path.resolve("./"), path.resolve("./node_modules")]
  }
```
